DOM.js (alpha)
==============
Modern javascript library for working with DOM

Overview
--------
Yep, another library for working with DOM. Everybody who manipulated with DOM in vanilla javascript knows that it has awful API. It has bugs, browser inconsistent behaviour etc. The library tries to fix that, it introduces it's own prototypes for document nodes.

Important to note that it doesn't cover everything, for instance there are no methods for AJAX.

* Firefox
* Opera

Alpha status
------------
